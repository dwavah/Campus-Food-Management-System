# CAMPUS-FOOD-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Campus Food Management System is designed to streamline and simplify the meal payment process for students through the integration of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology and micro-controllers. 
The system addresses common inefficiencies in traditional payment methods, such as long queues, security risks, and manual cash handling, by offering a secure, cashless alternative. Students are issued NFC cards linked to their accounts, enabling seamless registration, meal selection, and balance deduction processes.
